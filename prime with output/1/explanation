the program goes through alot of process befor its execution naming [the file contains the c++ program for a problem - (abc.cpp) ]:

1. Preprocessor
The preprocessor does all the preprocessing for th e compiler to head on toward the flow of the execution. as it fills all the value 
to the variables applied in the code, and also includes the values from the #define function it replaces its variable from its values.
It forms the abc.i from the abc.cpp file.

2. Compiler 
It translates (compiles) source code written in a high-level language (e.g., C++) into a set of machine-language instructions
that can be understood by the machine. It forms the abc.s from the abc.i file.


3. Assembler
it converts the machine language into  computer understandable code 0's and 1's.It forms the abc.o from the abc.i file.

4. Linker
 a linker or link editor is a computer system program that takes one or more object files (generated by a compiler or an assembler) 
 and combines them into a single executable file, library file, or another "object" file.It forms the abc.cpp from the abc.o file.
