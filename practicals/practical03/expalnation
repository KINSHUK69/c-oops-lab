Task 1 explanation :
when the iostream is not included the compilter show a fatal error ,
while printing i.e, using the cout << funcion as it it included in the iostream  libarary

Task 2 explanation :
the preprocessor doesnot include the #include<iostream> libraries for the  code it's the job of the linker.
But it involves the #define function ,as it creates the symbolic constants called macros.and it replaces the
variable defined in it  by their described values.

Task 3 explanation :
when a character initaialization takes palce using the cin >> function it does the implicit type casting if the
variable,but when the variable is printed it only prints the first value of the input . this  happens as
the cin >> function is change into the get() and it only reads the first value of the input .
But  if want to solve the problem we have to us the getline() instead of the cin>> function as it reads the entire input of the user.
