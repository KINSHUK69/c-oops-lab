1.  The code will be able to pass the preprocessor phase of the compiler but not the compilation 
phase of the compiler and it will generate two same errors that is invalid operands to binary 
expression because the concatenation of string and integer is not allowed by the g++ compiler.

2.  reverse iterators can be used to reverse the string using simple for loop without the reverse loop method.
the string is stored in another variable and the later on compared with one another.


5.  ASCII difference between two strings is returned by the string compare function.
Example :- Suppose string str1="a" and string str2="B" so the function str1.compare(str2) 
will return the difference of ASCII value of str1 and str2 which is 31 because the ASCII value of 'a' is 97 
and the ASCII value of 'B' is 66 .
So 97-66=31 therefore compare() function returns the difference of the ASCII value of two strings.

6.  As we can see from the code that c++ does not create any other reference of the string rather
than it modifies the same string as we can see that the address of the string is same before and
after modifing of the string so we can say that strings in c++ are mutable. It means that we can 
change the value of the string whenever we want and we can also see this from the code.
